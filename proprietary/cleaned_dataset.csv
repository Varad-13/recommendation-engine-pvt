Earn Up to $1600 Month Writing for Survival/Outdoors Blog | $3 per 100 words | 400 Word Trial Offer,2021-11-12T03:07:44.705Z,"Looking to pay a writer up to $400+ a week to write content for either my survival or outdoors blog at a rate of $3 per 100 words (3Â¢ per word). 

The first job offer will be for the first 400 words of an article and I'll hire you for the other 1000+ words if you write the first 400 good. This way I can see your writing skill and how you follow guidelines. If you accept the job I'll let you know how I like my blog articles written and you can decide if you want to accept or not.

All articles will be informational posts only.

For example, I may give you the keyword ""how to survive a bear attack"" and you'll have to write a 1,000+ word blog article on the subject. I expect you to research the topic thoroughly so you can be as helpful as possible to the reader.

Make sure to write pineapple at the beginning of your message to let me know you read the job offer all the way through.

Look forward to hearing from you! 

P.S. My total monthly spending is $1600+ but I'll be hiring multiple writers to fulfill my content needs. This means it's unlikely for you to make the total amount unless you're an exceptional writer who can write 53,000+ words a month. So I guess it's technically possible, just highly unlikely.","Blog Writing, Content Writing, SEO Writing, Blog Content",$12

iOS App to display multi media with a basic map integration,2022-01-06T01:34:16.459Z,"Need an MVP version of an iOS app. Based on the results, there are many enhancements that we'd like to make over time, so this project will expand after a successful first version.

The app will require front end and back end development including any database work, APIs, etc. You will be starting with designs only. 

The app will pull content (text, photos, audio) from a server so that the app can be used offline. 

The app will include the following pages:

1) A 'Welcome' page with text and images and a 'get started' link
2) 'Overview' pages that contain text, images, a button to play a pre-recorded audio clip and 3-4 links to other pages in the app (there will be multiple 'Overview' pages, but each will have the same layout, links and content.
3) 'Map' pages for each 'Overview' page. Each map page will display a 'Location' as well as the user's location. 
4) 'Location' pages for each 'Overview' page. Each location page will auto-start when the user reaches the location on page 3. The location page will have a button to play a pre-recorded audio clip and play a slideshow of images in sync with the audio clip. This may be a audio/video file if easier. The user should be able to replay, the audio/pictures. This page will also have a link that goes to the next 'Overview' page.

There may be multiple sets of 2-4, as many as 10. 

5) 'Thank You' page that is displayed after all the above sets are complete. The thank you page will include text, images and a few links - including external links to Safari and to Facebook for sharing.

We are open to recommendations on how to store the required data. The app should pull in all of the content (audio, video, text, images, location data, etc.) required for the full session.

The app will also have a 'publisher' version to create the experiences above. 

I have a prototype and many of the image assets already. They are in a Figma design.

If you are interested, I can provide a link to a website that's in development that provides an overview of the solution. It will explain better what the app will do and the purpose of the publisher app.

Short API code for Twilio and Zoho,2022-01-08T21:04:03.025Z,"Referrence Zoho Cliq status of 2 agents via API. RESTF API Documentation here https://www.zoho.com/cliq/help/restapi/v2/#retrieve-current-status

I have a twimlet setup in Twilio Studio that calls to 2 cell phones before being forwarded to voicemail if no answer. I would like an api call to Zoho Cliq to see current status of these 2 agents before proceeding to twimlet. If either agent status is set to ""Do Not Disturb"", I would like to reference a different twimlet that does not include that number.

I can have alternative twimlets already in studio, just need to link to appropriate twimlet based on Zoho Cliq status of ""Do Not Disturb""

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional offer if interested. This would be before sending to mobile numbers.

Need call sent to alternative number if status in Zoho Phonebridge is ""Available"".  This would be based off zoho phonebridge api.  If status is available, attempt to call to twilio number associated with Zoho CRM. If there is no answer at the zoho CRM, call would be directed to voicemail number (which is number associated with Zoho Desk). Call cannot end at zoho crm if not answered.

This is a more advanced setup in twilio and not a requirement for listing. Only needed if this is something you would like to attempt.

This is the flow. 
Inbound call to twilio. Route to zoho crm if phone bridge status available.
If no answer or unavailable, route to mobile numbers via twimlet based on available status.
Finally, route to Zoho Desk number that is used as voicemail box.","Twilio API, API, API Development, Zoho CRM, API Integration, Automation",$20

Interactive PowerBI-Dashboard for visualizing Business Capabilities (hierarchical map of boxes),2022-01-07T08:58:08.072Z,"I need an interactive and appealing visual presentation of Business Capabilities within PowerBI. Business Capabilities describe the high-level abilities of a company (represented by boxes) that are structured in a hierarchical order and can have multiple levels (depth). Attached, you find a screenshot of a static PowerPoint implementation that shows you exactly what I need. This map contains three levels of capabilities (e.g. level 1: ""Strategic Management""; level 2: ""Strategy Development""; level 3: ""Define Strategy""). The maximum number of levels should not exceed 5.

I would be glad if the visual representation within PowerBI is as close to the given one as possible. But I am also open to other visual representations or other Microsoft tools (MS Visio?) if necessary.

I have the following functional requirements for the interactive Dashboard:
The business capabilities will be stored/edited in a table structure (Name, ID, parent-child-relation, probably further data fields later...). This table must be imported and interpreted by PowerBI, so that no manual editing of the map is necessary if further capabilities are added, removed, or relocated. Please provide a corresponding Excel table with dummy data for this dashboard.
I need a slicer feature, to filter or highlight capabilities based on their properties. E.g. I want to annotate capabilities regarding high criticality and low criticality. I want to be able to have a slicer element to highlight respectively fade-out/grey-out filtered capabilities in the dashboard. The same should be possible for continuous values (e.g. a heatmap based on properties within a range of 0-100).
As in the given PPT example, I want to be able to define the style/color of the capabilities within the source table. This is for a higher visual appeal towards the audience.

I expect a PowerBI-file that contains the dashboard including the slicer elements so that I can edit it further on my own. Furthermore, I also need an Excel file with some dummy data, that I can, later on, replace with the actual business capabilities.

Annotate map image and add captions to images for proposal document,2021-12-09T09:50:43.391Z,"Hi, I'm looking for someone to finalize the graphics for a proposal to be sent to a potential client. I will send the materials after reviewing portfolios. So for now, just give a ballpark estimate for the initial bid. (If you prefer to do this on an hourly basis that is possible. By the way, the average hourly rate shown is not representative because several of my previous contracts involved lawyers!)

Note that this does not involve detailed graphics editing to create new content. Instead you will be making a few enhancements to existing images.

The main work will be to annotate an existing map to highlight why there are problems in the client's current location. This will involve the following steps:
- Add six phrases (e.g., ""waste"" and ""more waste"") in large prominent font.
- Impose image for nearby business (e.g., the review summary from Google Maps),
- Add a few icons to make more intuitive (e.g., dump trucks).
I'll supply all the images, so you will be mainly combining them and adding text.

You will also create a separate version of the map with space for 'from' and 'to' addresses. The result will be formatted so that it fits on the front of a 8x11"" envelop. It will also be used inside as a glossy attachment (full page).

The other graphics work will just involve adding captions to images for incorporation into a document. This should be editable with Microsoft Word, but PDF would be fine.

Summary of work:
1. Full-sized annotated Google Map of business location w/ a few textual annotations and icons.
2. Reduced version including 'from' and 'to' address text annotations
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
3. 2 pages of half-page attachments: 2 maps and 2 search results.
4. 1 full-page attachment: web search results in landscape mode
   [to be printed on full-sized envelop sticker paper].
Note: 1 is the main task; 2 is slight variation of 1, and, 3 & 4 involve adding captions to existing images.

Dropshipping - Transfer mapping from Oberlo account to DSers account,2021-11-14T10:14:55.021Z,"Hello,

DISCLAIMER :)

I'm not looking for someone to deal with my orders or any fulfillments tasks or mapping the products.

I'm looking for someone who can solve my syncing issue between Oberlo & DSers


Here's the situation : there is a Shopify store using Oberlo to do drosphipping.

Now the store uses DSers.

But all the mapping is missing.

The sync button has been used (this one https://ibb.co/vPhytVT) but most of the products have not been synced (like 99%).

There's a explanation message mentioning the potential causes of the non-sync (this one https://ibb.co/Gtjmypv).

The issue is that it's impossible that those reasons lead to 99% not being synced.

In order to filter out low-quality freelancers, please start your application message by âOBERLO2DSERSâ. If you don't, you will drastically reduce your chances.

Indeed, a freelancer who will have taken the time to read thoroughly this job description is what we are looking for.

Also, please ask the questions you may have and make an offer (I put 50$ for the sake of having an offer but I'm open to the discussion).

Looking forward to reading your application message!

P.S. : I will provide the Loom I shared with DSers chat support to the people who will apply ""correctly"".

Build a page with google maps and APIs (Angular),2021-12-12T03:02:18.732Z,"Hi,
I'm looking for someone experienced to do the project.
the project basically is:
one page contains 4 input and a google map.
the inputs are an APIs
the 4 inputs are:
1- City
2- Area or District
3- block
4- Plot

and every input has a ""geo"" object in it, which is the polygons for each data, I want to reflect that In the map, and draw their polygons.

so I want for example if I choose City X, I want to map interact with the user, it'll zoom to the location and show the polygon of the city, and so goes on for the other fields.

+ I want to add a feature ""take me to the location"" to take the user to google maps to see the directions.

Thanks.","TypeScript, Angular, API",$150
