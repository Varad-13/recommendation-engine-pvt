We have an existing SquareSpace Website with alot of pages. Big part of it is ""custom"" coded.

Unfortunately our existing dev is not able to continue the project and we need a new, reliable, skilled and trustworthy coder for the maintenance and development of the site.

This is not a fulltime Website development project. The page itself runs fine and content is being added by our assistants.

We need you to implement changes and fixes that require custom coding and advanced CSS knowledge.

Right now, the task at hand would be to implement an A/B test, We have a page with a button that redirects to another page within the site. We want to implement an A/B test with button redirect vs. button click opens a popup

If you apply to his job, please mention a possible solution to this requirement for us to understand that a) you read the job description and b) you understand requirements and c) you know your stuff

Must have:

- DOING ATTITUDE: if a requirement from us is wild and on a first glimpse hard or impossible to implement, we want you to say ""Yes it's going to be done whatever it takes"" instead of ""no can do""

- RESPONSIVE: We don't need you on standby 24/7 but you have to guarantee, that you check at least twice a day your messages and answer if there's a new task. Should be unavailable for a few days, no problem, all we ask is communication.

- EYE FOR DESIGN AND DETAIL (you won't design, for that we have an inhouse designer but you will have to implement all designs pixel perfect)

- ENGLISH or GERMAN: You need to be fluent in English and able to understand and communicate complex interconnections. We will make a zoom interview to verify that. Alternatively if you speak German that's perfect and valid.

Of course you need long experience and high skills in SquareSpace and general understanding of web development.
